# Appearance Skins



Each of the controls included in the RadControls for ASP.NET AJAX suite is styled with **two css files** that are loaded in certain order. The first one - ControlName.css, also called  **base stylesheet** contains CSS properties and values that are commonfor all skins, i.e it is layout-specific, not skin-specific. These are CSS float, padding, margin, font-size, font-family, etc.In the general case, when creating a custom skin for a control this file should not be edited, unless the custom skin needs different sizes, paddings or margins. The second file represents the actual skin of the control, and its name consists of the control name plus the skin name,i.e - Menu.Default.css. Upon creating a custom skin for the control, one should edit that particular file, as it contains skin-specificCSS properties, and references to images, colors, borders and backgrounds.

**RadMenu** uses **skins** to control the overall look-and-feel of the menu. A skin is a set of images and a CSS stylesheet that can be applied to the menu elements (items, images, etc.) and defines their look and feel. To apply a skin to the menu, set its **Skin** property, either using the properties pane or the **RadMenu** [Smart Tag]({%slug menu/design-time/smart-tag%}).

**RadMenu** is installed with a number of built-in skins: ![RadMenu Skins](images/menu-skins.png)

## Customizing Skins

You can tweak the existing skins, or create your own. Each skin has two main elements: images and a stylesheet. When creating your own, it is a good idea to start with the stylesheet for an existing skin and alter that. See [Tutorial: Creating a Custom Skin]({%slug menu/appearance-and-styling/creating-custom-skin%}) for a step-by-step walk through. To use your own skin

1. Add the new CSS file to your project.

1. Drag and drop the CSS file from the Project Explorer onto your Web page.

1. Set the **EnableEmbeddedSkins** property of the **RadMenu** to **False**.

The stylesheet for a **RadMenu** skin has the name **Menu.[SkinName].css** and can be found in the **...Skins/[SkinName]** directory. The images are found in the **...Skins/[SkinName]/Menu** directory. For example, the stylesheet for the "Black" skin is called Menu.Black.css and is located in the ...Skins/Black directory. The images are found in the ...Skins/Black/Menu directory. The images are referenced by name from within the stylesheet.
